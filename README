addTaxa is an R package to add missing taxa to complete phylogenies. Taxonomic information
is used to add such taxa. The input will often be a molecular phylogeny, or otherwise
"accepted" phylogeny. Optionally, named clades can be tracked through the addition process,
and optionally the absolute diversification rates of these named clades can be tracked
to determine their sensitivity to missing taxa.
